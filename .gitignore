# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor

#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/core/.bundle

# Ignore all environment files (except templates).
/core/.env*
!/core/.env*.erb

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/core/log/*
/core/tmp/*
!/core/log/.keep
!/core/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/core/tmp/pids/*
!/core/tmp/pids/
!/core/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore storage (uploaded files in development and any SQLite databases).
/core/storage/*
!/core/storage/.keep
/core/tmp/storage/*
!/core/tmp/storage/
!/core/tmp/storage/.keep

/core/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/core/config/master.key

/core/app/assets/builds/*
!/core/app/assets/builds/.keep
